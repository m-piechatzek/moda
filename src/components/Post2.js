                           Here’s my look from the recent Anthropologie rooftop
                           dinner party that I attend a few weeks ago. If you
                           haven’t checked out that post, I told the
                           Anthropologie NYC team what I was into and they styled
                           me up perfectly! I’m all about this statement sleeve
                           moment for a twist on the many off the shoulder tops
                           already in my closet — cause how many is too many,
                           really?
                         </p>

                           Sister, sister! Sister, sister. I got my own mind…but
                           still seem to dress like my sister all the time. If
                           you got the Sister, Sister reference and sang that
                           last sentence to the tune of the show’s theme song,
                           then here is a digital hug from me to you, friend!
                           Loved that show. But seriously, my sister Jessica
                           (isn’t she just adorbs?) and I have always had
                            similar styles. We never fail to pick out the same
                            exact pieces and find them in each others closets.
                          </p>

                            It’s the craziest thing! So, when LOFT asked us to
                            style up their current collection in honor of
                            National Sister’s Day—they’re celebrating all month
                            long—it was no surprise that we both picked wrap
                            silhouettes + ruffles. I have a handful of ruffle
                            embellished pieces from LOFT and can’t seem to get
                            enough. This cold shoulder chambray top was a welcome
                            addition to the pack. And there’s no doubt that I’ll
                            be borrowing this wrap dress from Jessica very soon.
                            Shop my edit of current favorites from LOFT above
                            including these looks and load more ruffles, of
                            course.
